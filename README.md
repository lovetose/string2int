# string2int Challenge

By using regular expression [^0-9] to remove all non number in string; we get only numbers in String; Then, using loop to to change each string aka. char then using -'0' to get actual value of String in number form. Then to get them into number form, I use 
"output = output * 10 + num.charAt(i)" to put each number next to each other for example (45abc6) would return 4 as hundreds, 5 as tens, and lastly 6 and ones accrodingly.
